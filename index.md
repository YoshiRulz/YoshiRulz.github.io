# My Projects
***
I've made some things which you're free to use or tinker with (or just look at).

GitHub Repo | Description | [BCH rating](https://bettercodehub.com/)
--:|:--|:--
[My dotfiles](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/dotfiles-plus) | Dotfiles, plus config I found myself copying a lot | N/A
[Circulyr compiler](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/circulyrc) | "Compiler" for a new song lyric markdown, Circulyr | N/A (unfinished)
[JTysh](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/JTysh) | An attempt at a (backwards-incompatible) Java shell | ![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/YoshiRulz/JTysh?branch=master)
[*Rayman 2* TAS scripts](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/Rayman2-TAS-scripts) | I'm working towards a *Rayman 2* [TAS](http://tasvideos.org/WelcomeToTASVideos.html) (with [BizHawk](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk)) | N/A (in Lua)

There's also some unstarted projects:

And there are some I've left to gather dust:

GitHub Repo | Description
--:|:--
[SciLib](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/SciLib) | Built to automate physics homework with dimensional analysis, there are similar libraries already (and they're probably better).
[nlsh](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/nlsh) | An attempt to let Linux newbies use the shell without having to "memorize all those commands". May eventually be ported to Java (JTysh).
[JTysh-NL](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/JTysh-NL) | See `nlsh`.

And, of course, there's [this website](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/YoshiRulz.github.io).

# Filler Content
You never know when you might need a copy of Lorem Ipsum or the default GH Pages site contents.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/YoshiRulz.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/YoshiRulz.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
