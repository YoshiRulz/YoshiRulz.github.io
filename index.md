# My Projects
***
I've made some things which you're free to use or tinker with (or just look at).

GitHub Repo | Description | [BCH rating](https://bettercodehub.com/)
--:|:--|:--
[My dotfiles](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/dotfiles-plus) | Dotfiles, plus config I found myself copying a lot | N/A
[Circulyr compiler](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/circulyrc) | "Compiler" for a new type of markdown for song lyrics, Circulyr | N/A (unfinished)
[JTysh](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/JTysh) | An attempt at a (backwards-incompatible) Java shell | ![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/YoshiRulz/JTysh?branch=master)
[*Rayman 2* TAS scripts](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/Rayman2-TAS-scripts) | I'm working towards a *Rayman 2* [TAS](http://tasvideos.org/WelcomeToTASVideos.html) (with [BizHawk](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk)) | N/A (in Lua)

There's also some unstarted projects:

GitHub Repo | Description
--:|:--
D940a [device](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/android_device_blu_d940a)/[kernel](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/blu-kernel-d940a) | LineageOS 14.1 port for the Blu *Vivo 4.8 HD* (forked from the *Nexus 4*)
[rsTux](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/rsTux) | Attempting to replace C w/ Rust in the Linux kernel (post-compile for now)

And there are some I've left to gather dust:

GitHub Repo | Description
--:|:--
[SciLib](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/SciLib) | Built to automate physics homework with dimensional analysis, there are similar libraries already (and they're probably better).
[nlsh](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/nlsh) | An attempt to let Linux newbies use the shell without having to "memorize all those commands". May eventually be ported to Java (JTysh).
[JTysh-NL](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/JTysh-NL) | See `nlsh`.

And, of course, there's [the website you're currently looking at](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/YoshiRulz.github.io).

I'm also *technically* a contributor on these cool projects:

User/Group | GitHub Repo | Description
--:|--:|:--
[TASVideos](http://tasvideos.org) | [BizHawk](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk) | Multi-system emulator with advanced recording and scripting functionality.
[Undertow Games](https://undertowgames.com) | [SCP:CB](https://github.com/Regalis11/scpcb) | First-person horror game set in the *Secure Contain Protect* universe.

# Wisdom of the Ancients
***
"*Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen an angry penguin charging at them in excess of [160 km/h]. They'd be a lot more careful about what they say if they had.*" — Linus Torvalds

## on Programming
***
"*Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.*" — Rick Cook

"*Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.*" — Bill Gates

"*Nobody actually creates perfect code the first time around, except me. But there's only one of me.*" — Linus Torvalds

(In the metadata of [xkcd#378](https://xkcd.com/378)) "*Real programmers set the universal constants at the start such that the universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want.*" — Randall Monroe

## on Software Education
***
"*You see, some people have a talent for programming. At ten to thirteen years old, typically, they're fascinated, and if they use a program, they want to know: 'How does it do this?' But when they ask the teacher, if it's proprietary, the teacher has to say: 'I'm sorry, it's a secret, we can't find out.' Which means education is forbidden. A proprietary program is the enemy of the spirit of education.*" — Richard Stallman

"*Programming is programming. If you get good at programming, it doesn't matter which language you learned it in, because you'll be able to do programming in any language. The hard part of programming is the same regardless of the language.*" — Richard Stallman

## on Free Software
***
"*To have the choice between proprietary software packages, is being able to choose your master. Freedom means not having a master. And in the area of computing, freedom means not using proprietary software.*" — Richard Stallman

"*If the users don't control the program, the program controls the users.*" — Richard Stallman

(When asked if governments should outlaw propietary software) "*...if you lose control over your computing, that's bad for you - directly bad for you. So my first reaction is to say: 'Oh, what a shame! I hope you recover the control over your computing (...and the way you do that is to stop using the non-free software).' First and foremost, you're the victim...*" — Richard Stallman

### on Windows
"*We've done some good work, but all of these products become obsolete so fast... It will be some finite number of years, and I don't know the number — before our doom comes.*" — Bill Gates

"*Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.*" — "*Really, I'm not out to destroy Microsoft. That will just be a completely unintentional side effect.*" — "*If Microsoft ever does applications for Linux it means I've won.*" — Linus Torvalds

"*It is unfortunate that he still has nonfree software in his computer. He needs to defenestrate it (which means either throw Windows out of the computer or throw the computer out of the window).*" — Richard Stallman
